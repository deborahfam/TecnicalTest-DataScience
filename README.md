## Problem Description

Write a program that given the numbers from 1 to 100 print “None” for each number. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of “None” and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

### Requirements

- [x] Train any classification algorithm (E.g. support vector machine ) to solve the test as a classic supervised classification problem with four classes.
- [x] Build your own dataset of any length, any preprocessing step in the input data is allowed.
- [x] Also, provide  the accuracy score obtained by the model with the test data (numbers from 1 - 100).
- [x] Provide a brief theoretical description of the designed model and data pipeline.
- [x] You must  share the implementation and documentation of the project using GitHub.

### Extra Points

- [x] Perform a ten folds cross-validation using  different classification algorithms and select the best among them.
- [] Update the documentation to support the selection (or not) of a new algorithm.
- [] Publish the trained model as a web service.
- [] Create unit tests for the implementation with a test coverage >=80%.

## Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful and versatile supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. The fundamental principle behind SVMs is to find an optimal hyperplane that separates the data points belonging to different classes with the largest margin.

### Data Pipeline

The data pipeline consists of several steps:

1. Dataset Generation: The dataset is generated by iterating over the numbers from 1 to 100. For each number, a corresponding label is assigned based on the FizzBuzz rules: "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5, and "None" for all other numbers.

2. Data Preprocessing: The generated dataset, containing both numbers and labels, is typically converted into a tabular format of pandas DataFrame. In this case, no additional preprocessing steps are required since the data is already in the correct format.

3. Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. The common practice is to use an 80-20 split, where 80% of the data is used for training the model and 20% for evaluating its performance.

4. Model Initialization: The SVM classifier, specifically the SVC class from the `sklearn.svm module`, is initialized with desired parameters. SVMs are a popular choice for classification tasks and work by finding an optimal hyperplane that separates the different classes in the data.

5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data. The predicted labels are then compared with the true labels to calculate the accuracy score, which measures the percentage of correct predictions over the total number of samples.
